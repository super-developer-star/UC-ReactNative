UC React Native App (Typescript)
==================

This project is based on the Mobile Starter Kit for [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) + [NativeBase](http://nativebase.io/) + [Redux](http://redux.js.org) + [CodePush](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) Apps (iOS & Android).

### Getting Started

```

You can also build using `tsc -p src` from the project folder.
